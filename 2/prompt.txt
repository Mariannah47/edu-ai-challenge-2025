you need to create a clear and well-structured bug ticket based on the following information: “Logout button doesn’t work on Safari. It just doesn’t respond.” The ticket should have the next fields:
- Title
- Description
- Steps to Reproduce
- Expected vs Actual Behavior
- Environment (if known)
- Severity or Impact

The expected result is a markdown with the requested information. Do not guess. Do not add not markdown-related comments.
