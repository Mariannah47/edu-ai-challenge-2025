3. Performance Requirements:
   - High read speed is crucial
   - Read/Write ratio: 80% reads, 20% writes
4. Scalability: Must handle growing user base effectively

Follow this structured analysis:

1. First, analyze each requirement individually and explain its implications for database selection
2. Consider the following aspects for each requirement:
   - Data structure implications
   - Performance considerations
   - Scalability factors
   - Consistency requirements
3. Evaluate different database types against these requirements
4. Provide a detailed comparison of the top 2-3 most suitable options
5. Make a final recommendation with clear justification
